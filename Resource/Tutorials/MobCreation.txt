You can also spawn a custom mob when using an item.

You can add potion effects to the mob

You can change which mob will be the ride (Which mob will be rided by the custom mob)

For 1.9+ users, attributes can be change.
Attributes allow you to change
  - Armor - The resistance of a mob
  - Armor Thoughness (Only for MC1.11+) - How much the mob Armor will spoil when dropped
  - Knockback Resistance - How much knockback a mob takes
  - Movement Speed - How much fast the mob moves
  - Attack Damage - How much damage the mob does

There are also abilities that can be triggered when the mob is being hit.
There is a chance system, it consist of a general chance and a per ability chance.

General trigger chance is the chance that an ability can eventually happen.
Ability trigger chance is the chance that the specific ability will trigger.

So if the general chance will be positive, this does not mean that an ability will effectively
happen, it does depends on per ability chances
Ability list:
        
          :[PotionEffectType ; Duration(Seconds) ; Level ; TriggerChance]
    potion:hunger;10;1;50 
    Add potion effect to who hit

        :[TriggerChance]
    push:10 
    Push away to who hit
    
    deflect 
    Deflect arrows. No triggerChance for this, will always happen, also overrides global triggerChance
        
          :[Duration(Second) ; TriggerChance]
    shield:2;25 
    Generate a shield that last X seconds and make the mob invulnerable
    
          :[Damage ; TriggerChance]
    damage:5;45 
    Damage the player

           :[FireDuration(Seconds) ; TriggerChance]
    lighter:5;65 
    Set the player on fire

          :[ArrowDamage ; ArrowQuantity ; TriggerChance]
    sniper:0.5;5;35

         :[MobType ; MobQuantity ; TriggerChance]
    spawn:zombie;2;25 
    Spawn some mobs

Rewards can be given to when the mob is KILLED BY A PLAYER.
There are three different drop type:
    - chest
        The drop will be given through a chest. This will also require a preview
        item that will be show floating above the chest
    - player
        The drop will be directly given to the killed (Dropped if the inventory is full)
    - drop
        Items will be simply dropped on the ground

You can add items from the plugin as a reward
custom
    [HopeItemName ; Quantity]
  - Egg;2

You can also add normal items with a simple name and lore
item: #Drop some items with custom name, lore and 
    [id;amount;name;lore1;lore2;lore3;...]
  - 'NAME_TAG;16;&cThis is the item name;&6ItemLore 1;&cItemLore 2;&7ItemLore 3'

You can commands to be executed
command:
  - heal %player%

And finally, the chance system. This use a weighted chance system and this mean that
the final chance (From 0 to 100%) will be the choosen value divided by the sum of all chances
If one item have 200 and the other 300, the first will be 200/500 (40%) the other 300/500 (60%)

FInally, you can set the equipment of the mob. You configure the equipped item completely
(Check ItemCreation.txt for reference). You can also add drop chance for the item.
