This flag that can be added into the HopeItems creation and allows to add an infite use of the item
removeOnUse: true

For blocks, will work in a different way. Placing block won't be infinite, but it will be their usage.
So, if a block have 
removeOnUse:true
the first time a player step on it or interact with it, the block will lose their effect.
